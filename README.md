# Reporting System

![Reporting System](https://github.com/reporting-system/master/img/screenshot.png "Reporting System")

This is a reporting system developed for my company that allows inspectors to login and submit life saftey issues that they may encounter during their daily inspections. Inspectors also have the ability to edit and delete their own reports.

## Technologies
* The back-end was coded in PHP where it queried the MySQL database.
* The front-end was coded using bootstrap and jQuery.
